# TAL-Net: Joint Forecasting of Regional Electricity Demand and COâ‚‚ Emissions

This repository contains the code and notebooks for my research project at Genesis Lab, London Metropolitan University.  
The project explores **deep learning-based approaches for joint forecasting of regional electricity demand and COâ‚‚ emissions**, applying and comparing multiple architectures including the proposed **TAL-Net (Temporal Attention LSTM Network)**.  
The study is based on regional U.S. datasets (California and Texas) and evaluates the models on standard forecasting metrics.
